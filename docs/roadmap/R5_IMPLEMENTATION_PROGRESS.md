# V2.3 R5 Implementation Progress

Date: 2026-09-19

This document records implementation progress only. It does not accept R5 and
does not authorize R6. The original V2.3 roadmap and frozen R5 design remain
authoritative.

## Completed Deterministic Work

- Added append-only R5 episode envelopes, lifecycle reduction, history-only
  snapshot construction, candidate-only payloads, discriminated research
  authorization, and the 500/500 budget ledger.
- Added the paired A0-A6 campaign protocol, counterbalanced runner, source/time
  holdout checks, arm reducer, and evidence inventory.
- Connected the internal profile seam to the existing `refactor` phase. The
  ordinary `refactor`, `optimize`, and `full` entrypoints remain the only
  product entrypoints; the profile is not a CLI option.
- Added a typed R5 runtime binding. A0/A1 cannot carry mutation bindings;
  A2/A3 require the appropriate authorization and existing R4 factory; A4-A6
  require snapshot and payload-manifest equality before snippets reach the
  existing Candidate prompt hook.
- R5 arms bypass the ordinary post-diagnostic Candidate loop. A0/A1 are
  observation-only; A2-A6 hand the unchanged main result to the existing R4
  controller, preserving the one-mutation and formal-validation boundary.
- Added a private typed capture of one existing `refactor` baseline and a
  product campaign executor that forks A0-A6 from that exact Candidate,
  diagnostic context, task, and formal result. Baseline usage is charged once;
  every arm receives an isolated BudgetManager, TraceRecorder, model adapter,
  validation workspace, and append-only artifact root.
- Corrected the conservative Vitis upper bound to count the common baseline's
  complete csim/csynth/cosim prefix. The runner now rejects work in A0, Vitis
  work in A1, and any arm that crosses its frozen Provider/Vitis upper bound.

## Verification

- Deterministic R5 and adjacent boundary tests: passed.
- Full repository regression: `2494` tests passed at implementation commit
  `75a4b49c4e5256f5a7ff36c2adc455d47851dba6`.
- This deterministic checkpoint consumed `0` new Provider calls and `0` new
  Vitis launches. The credential was removed from the test environment.

## Current Data Boundary

The immutable predecessor inventory reports `64` historical Provider calls and
`180` historical Vitis launches. They are predecessor evidence, not R5 budget
consumption. One earlier full-regression invocation unintentionally reached a
legacy conditional network smoke after the R5 authorization started. It is
therefore charged to R5 even though it was not an efficacy experiment. The
reconciled R5 ledger is `1/500` Provider calls and `0/500` Vitis launches.

The current inventory is not a campaign dataset: it has no frozen history/
future partition and no paired positive/inapplicable controls. The generated
`r5_dataset_contract.py` output therefore stays
`blocked_data_acquisition`, does not create a Trusted revision, and forbids a
real campaign. Historical reports or Package D canaries must not be relabeled
as an R5 future set.

## Next Authorized Step

Audit the 20 candidate benchmark roots under `src/hlsrewritter` and create an
immutable eligibility manifest with explicit acceptance/rejection reasons.
Only cases with enforceable Public/Hidden oracles, complete Target/toolchain/
parser/model identity, temporal provenance, source-level holdout, and paired
controls may enter the dataset. Re-run the inventory and dataset contract,
then perform a zero-call protocol audit before the bounded real pilot. R6
remains stopped.
